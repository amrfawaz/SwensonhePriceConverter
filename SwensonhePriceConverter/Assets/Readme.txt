IV. Which architecture would you use for the required task below? Why?

- I used MVVM design pattern.
There are many advantage using MVVM:
1- Make tha application maintainable: By deviding application to smaller seperated part of codes, each part focus on specific function. So maintaining small part is more easier than maintaining a bulk of code.
2- Scalablity: By making each part of code seperated, it can be reused and you the application can be scalable.
3- Testablity: Due to seperation of code, each part of code can be tested. Also you can In MVVM the business logic is completly seperated from UI logic so testing each part become more easier.
